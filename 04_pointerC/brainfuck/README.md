You're working on an array. 

The `>` operator moves one field to the right on the array

The `<` operator moves one field to the left on the array

The `.` operator prints the current cellvalue out

The `,` operator reads a char from the commandline

The `+` increments the current cellvalue

The `-` decrements the current cellvalue

The `[` looks on the current cellvalue, if it is 0 it jumps after the `]`

The `]` jumps back to the `]`
