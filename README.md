Repository is very old, what I've learned and should do better:
- branching to spare commits and get a smaller commit history
- don't use scripts like that https://github.com/dan1el789/OperatingSystem/blob/master/resources/_commit.sh because it can add files you potentially don't want to add to your repository (e.g. generated source code)
- if you introduce scripts like that https://github.com/dan1el789/OperatingSystem/blob/master/resources/_run.sh do them as an alias  
- don't use copy scripts in basically every folder https://github.com/dan1el789/OperatingSystem/blob/master/newTask.sh 
- this is a workaround for an alias https://github.com/dan1el789/OperatingSystem/blob/master/deliver-update.sh
