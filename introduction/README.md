# Which operating System can be seen as the first operating System?
page 7 - The  first  true  digital  computer  was  designed  by  the  English  mathematician  Charles  Babbage  (1792-1871).   Although  Babbage  spent most  of his  life  and  for-tune  trying  to  build his  "analytical  engine,"  he  never got  it  working  properly  be-cause  it  was  purely  mechanical,  and  the  technology  of his  day  could  not  produce  the  required  wheels,  gears,  and  cogs  to  the  high precision  that  he  needed.  Need-less to say, the analytical engine  did not have an operating  system.  As  an  interesting  historical  aside,  Babbage  realized  that  he  would  need  soft-ware  for his analytical  engine,  so he hired  a young  woman  named  Ada Lovelace, who  was  the  daughter  of  the  famed  British  poet  Lord Byron,  as  the  world's  first  programmer.  The  programming  language Ada® is  named  after her.
page 10 - Typical  operating systems were FMS (the Fortran Monitor System)  and IBSYS,  IBM's operating  system for the 7094. 

# Why was there no need for an operating system in the first computergeneratioin
page 8 -  All programming was done in absolute machine language, or even worse yet, by wiring up electrical cir-cuits  by  connecting  thousands  of  cables  to  plugboards  to  control  the  machine's  basic  functions.

# Explain what a resource in context of an operating system is/represents and provide an example
page 6 - When  a computer  (or network)  has multiple users,  the  need  for  managing  and  protecting  the  memory,  I/O  devices,  and  other resources  is even  greater,  since  the  users  might  otherwise  interfere  with  one  another.   In  addition,  users  often  need  to  share  not  only  hardware,  but  information  (files,  databases,  etc.)  as  well.   In short, this  view  of  the  operating  system  holds  that  its  primary  task  is  to  keep  track  of  which  programs  are  using  which  resource,  to  grant  resource  requests,  to  account  for usage,  and to  mediate  conflicting  requests  from different  programs and  users.  
# What  is  Multiplexing?  Explain  the  difference  between  Time  and  Space  Multiplexing. Find examples outside of computer science. 

# What is the main task of current operating systems?

# Explain the term Multi-Programming and find the term we are using today instead.

# Is CPU usage better with Multi-Programming? What does CPU usage represent?

# Explain Time-Sharing and are we currently using Time-Sharing with our operating systems such as Windows and Linux?
