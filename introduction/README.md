# Which operating System can be seen as the first operating System?
page 7 - The  first  true  digital  computer  was  designed  by  the  English  mathematician  Charles  Babbage  (1792-1871).   Although  Babbage  spent most  of his  life  and  for-tune  trying  to  build his  "analytical  engine,"  he  never got  it  working  properly  be-cause  it  was  purely  mechanical,  and  the  technology  of his  day  could  not  produce  the  required  wheels,  gears,  and  cogs  to  the  high precision  that  he  needed.  Need-less to say, the analytical engine  did not have an operating  system.  As  an  interesting  historical  aside,  Babbage  realized  that  he  would  need  soft-ware  for his analytical  engine,  so he hired  a young  woman  named  Ada Lovelace, who  was  the  daughter  of  the  famed  British  poet  Lord Byron,  as  the  world's  first  programmer.  The  programming  language AdaÂ® is  named  after her.
page 10 - Typical  operating systems were FMS (the Fortran Monitor System)  and IBSYS,  IBM's operating  system for the 7094. 

# Why was there no need for an operating system in the first computergeneratioin
page 8 -  All programming was done in absolute machine language, or even worse yet, by wiring up electrical cir-cuits  by  connecting  thousands  of  cables  to  plugboards  to  control  the  machine's  basic  functions.
